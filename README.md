This project focuses on predicting breast cancer risk using various machine learning models and explainable AI (XAI) techniques. It integrates data preprocessing, model development, performance evaluation, and interpretability analysis using a range of methods and libraries.

The models and techniques implemented in this project include:

XGBoost Classifier
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Dempster-Shafer 
Explainable AI (XAI) techniques:
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
LRP (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation)

Folder Contents

This directory contains the datasets used for model training and evaluation, as well as the Python code implementing each method and explanation technique. 

Some Python libraries used may not be pre-installed, depending on your environment. Use pip install to install any missing dependencies.
Google Colab users may encounter session-related issues, especially with model persistence, SHAP visualizations, and LRP integration. Restarting the runtime and re-running cells may help.
Ensure that the dataset files remain in the same folder as the scripts for proper loading and execution.
